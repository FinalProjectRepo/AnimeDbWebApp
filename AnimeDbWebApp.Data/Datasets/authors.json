    "about": "Naoki Urasawa's career as a manga artist spans more than twenty years and has firmly established him as one of the true manga masters of Japan. Born in Tokyo in 1960, Urasawa debuted with BETA! in 1983 and hasn't stopped his impressive output since. Well-versed in a variety of genres, Urasawa's oeuvre encompasses a multitude of different subjects, such as a romantic comedy (Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl), a suspenseful human drama about a former mercenary (Pineapple ARMY; story by Kazuya Kudo), a captivating psychological suspense story (Monster), a sci-fi adventure manga (20th Century Boys), and a modern reinterpretation of the work of the God of Manga, Osamu Tezuka (Pluto: Urasawa x Tezuka; co-authored with Takashi Nagasaki, supervised by Macoto Tezka, and with the cooperation of Tezuka Productions). Many of his books have spawned popular animated and live-action TV programs and films, and 2008 saw the theatrical release of the first of three live-action Japanese films based on 20th Century Boys.\n\nNo stranger to accolades and awards, Urasawa is a three-time recipient of the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award, a two-time recipient of the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize, and has received the Kodansha Manga Award. Similarly, Monster has been nominated twice for the Eisner Award in America. Urasawa has also become involved in the world of academia, and in 2008 accepted a guest teaching post at Nagoya Zokei University, where he teaches courses in, of course, manga.\n\nTwitter: @urasawa_naoki\nYouTube: @-urasawachannel-5463"

    "about": "Date of Death: May 6, 2021\n\nKentarou Miura was born in Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan in 1966. He was left-handed. In 1976, at the early age of 10, Miura made his first manga, titled Miuranger, that was published for his classmates in a school publication; the manga ended up spanning 40 volumes. In 1977, Miura created his second manga titled Ken e No Michi (The Way to the Sword), using Indian ink for the first time. When he was in middle school in 1979, Miura's drawing techniques improved greatly as he started using professional drawing techniques. His first doujinshi was published, with the help of friends, in a magazine in 1982. That same year, Miura enrolled in an artistic curriculum in high school, where he and his classmates started publishing their works in school booklets, as well as having his first doujinshi published in a fan-produced magazine. In 1985, Miura applied for the entrance examination of an art college in Nihon University. He submitted Futanabi for examination and was granted admission. This project was later nominated for the Best New Author work in Weekly Shounen Magazine. Another Miura manga titled Noa was published in Weekly Shounen Magazine the very same year. Due to a disagreement with one of the editors, the manga was stalled and eventually dropped altogether. This is approximately when Miura's career hit a slump.\n\nIn 1988, Miura bounced back with a 48-page manga known as Berserk Prototype, as an introduction to the current Berserk fantasy world. It went on to win Miura a prize from the Comi Manga School. In 1989, after receiving a doctorate degree, Kentarou started a project titled Ourou (King of Wolves), based on a script by Buronson, the writer of Hokuto no Ken. It was published in Monthly Animal House magazine in issues 5 and 7 of that year.\n\nIn 1990, a sequel was made to Ourou titled Ourouden that was published as a prequel to the original in Young Animal magazine. In the same year, the 6th issue of Monthly Animal House, the first volume of the solo project Berserk was released with a relatively limited success. Miura again collaborated with Buronson on a manga titled Japan that was published in Young Animal from the 1st issue to the 8th of 1992, and was later released as a stand-alone tankoubon. Miura's fame grew after Berserk was serialized in Young Animal in 1992 with the release of \"The Golden Age\" story arc, and the huge success of his masterpiece made of him one of the most prominent contemporary mangaka. At this time, Miura dedicated himself solely to work on Berserk. He indicated, however, that he intended to publish more manga in the future.\n\nIn 1997, Miura supervised the production of 25 anime episodes of Berserk that aired in the same year on NTV. Various art books and supplemental materials by Miura based on Berserk were also released. In 1999, Miura made minor contributions to the Dreamcast video game Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage. 2004 saw the release of yet another video game adaptation titled Berserk Millennium Falcon Arc: Chapter of the Record of the Holy Demon War.\n\nThe Berserk manga has also spawned a whole host of merchandise, both official and fan-made, ranging from statues and action figures to key rings, video games, and a trading card game. In 2002, Kentarou Miura received second place in the Osamu Tezuka Culture Award of Excellence for Berserk.\n\nMiura provided the designs for the Vocaloid Kamui Gakupo, whose voice is taken from the Japanese singer and actor, Gackt.\n\nKentarou Miura died on May 6, 2021 due to an acute aortic dissection at 54 years old."

Almost 100 million Clamp tankōbon copies have been sold worldwide as of October 2007.\n\nBeginning as an eleven-member dōjinshi circle in the mid-1980s, they began creating original work in 1987. By the time they debuted with RG Veda in 1989, the group was reduced to seven members. In 1993, three more members left, leaving the four members who are currently still part of the group. In 2006, the members decided to change their names; Ohkawa later changed her name back from Ageha Ohkawa to Nanase Ohkawa, while the other three members retained their new names. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nTwitter: @CLAMP_news"

    "about": "Hometown: Niigata, Niigata, Japan\nBlood type: A+'\nZodiac: Libra\n\nRumiko Takahashi is one of the wealthiest women in Japan. The manga she creates (and its anime adaptations) are very popular in the United States and Europe where they have been released as both manga and anime in English translation. Her works are relatively famous worldwide, and many of her series were some of the forerunners of early English language manga to be released in the nineties. Takahashi is also the best selling female comics artist in history; well over 100 million copies of her various works have been sold.\n\nThough she was said to occasionally doodle in the margins of her papers while attending Niigata Chuuou High School, Takahashi's interest in manga did not come until later. During her college years, she enrolled in Gekiga Sonjuku, a manga school founded by Kazuo Koike, mangaka of Crying Freeman and Lone Wolf and Cub. Under his guidance Rumiko Takahashi began to publish her first doujinshi creations in 1975, such as Bye-Bye Road and Star of Futile Dust. Kozue Koike often urged his students to create well-thought out, interesting characters, and this influence would greatly impact Rumiko Takahashi's works throughout her career.\n\nCareer and major works:\n\nTakahashi's professional career began in 1978. Her first published story was Those Selfish Aliens, a comedic science fiction story. During the same year, she published Time Warp Trouble, Shake Your Buddha, and the Golden Gods of Poverty in Shounen Sunday, which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years. Later that year, Rumiko attempted her first full-length series, Urusei Yatsura. Though it had a rocky start due to publishing difficulties, Urusei Yatsura would become one of the most beloved anime and manga comedies in Japan.\n\nIn 1980, Rumiko Takahashi found her niche and began to publish with regularity. At this time she started her second major series, Maison Ikkoku, in Big Comic Spirits. Written for an older audience, Maison Ikkoku is often considered to be one of the all-time best romance manga. Takahashi managed to work on Maison Ikkoku on and off simultaneously with Urusei Yatsura. She concluded both series in 1987, with Urusei Yatsura ending at 34 volumes, and Maison Ikkoku being 15.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Takahashi became a prolific writer of short story manga, which is surprising considering the massive lengths of most of her works. Her stories The Laughing Target, Maris the Chojo, and Fire Tripper all were adapted into original video animations (OVAs). In 1984, after the end of Urusei Yatsura and Maison Ikkoku, Takahashi took a different approach to storytelling and began the dark, macabre Mermaid Saga. This series of short segments was published sporadically until 1994, with the final story being Mermaid's Mask. Many fans contend that this work remains unfinished by Takahashi, since the final story does not end on a conclusive note.\n\nAnother short work left untouched is One-Pound Gospel, which, like Mermaid Saga, was published erratically. The last story to be drawn was published in 2001, however just recently she wrote one final chapter concluding the series\n\nLater in 1987, Takahashi began her third major series, Ranma ½. Following the late 80s and early 90s trend of shounen martial arts manga, Ranma ½ features a gender-bending twist. The series continued for nearly a decade until 1996, when it ended at 38 volumes. Ranma ½ is one of Rumiko Takahashi's most popular series with the Western world.\n\nDuring the later half of the 1990s, Rumiko Takahashi continued with short stories and her installments of Mermaid Saga and One-Pound Gospel until beginning her fourth major work, InuYasha. While Ranma ½, Urusei Yatsura, and Maison Ikkoku all were heavily seated in the romantic comedy genre, InuYasha was more akin to her dark Mermaid Saga. The series became her most eclectic work, featuring action, romance, horror, fantasy, (folklore-based) historical fiction, and comedy.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nTwitter: @rumicworld1010"

She currently lives in Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, and also has a daughter.\n\nShe began her career as a doujinshi artist creating doujinshi for works such as Saint Seiya, Captain Tsubasa and Maouden.\n\nShe debuted in a commercial magazine with the original work Metal Heart (serialised in Kobunsha's Comic VAL from November 1986). After her debut, she continued to contribute on numerous doujin works. However, the later disbanding of a doujin circle, Yajou Teikoku, she had founded with Maki Chikura, led to her taking numerous breaks from her commercial works. Due to this, there were incomplete works penned by her during this period.\n\nDuring her years in middle school, she had been a fan of Masami Kurumada's manga series Ring ni Kakero, Fuuma no Kojirou, Saint Seiya and B't X (serialised in Weekly Shounen Jump), sending Kurumada numerous fan letters asking to meet him, after which Kurumada finally agreed, inviting her to his workplace.\n\nWhen asked about her penname in an interview in the September 2006 issue of Puff, she responded that she had originally thought of making it Kouga Jun, but subsequently changed it to Kouga Yun.\n\nAmong her noted works is Loveless, which has been serialised in Monthly Comic Zero Sum since 2002 and is ongoing, as well as her work Tenshichou (天使庁). She has also worked as an illustrator on the noted literary magazine Faust.\n\nIn 2007, she contributed the character designs to the Sunrise anime series, Mobile Suit Gundam 00.\n\n(Source: AniDB)\n\nTwitter: @yunk99\nBlog: http://yunkouga.jugem.jp/"

She likes Harry Potter and anime by Hayao Miyazaki. She calls herself an otaku.[citation needed] Western children's books like Anne of Green Gables (for which she drew the cover artwork in a republished version in 2011) she read as a child had a notable influence on her work, especially how she chooses to portray unusual family constellations.\n\nIn 2000, Umino's most notable work, Honey and Clover, began serialization in Shueisha's manga magazine, CUTiEcomic. The series' first fourteen chapters were published in CUTiEcomic; serialization was later moved to Young YOU. With the demise of Young YOU in 2005, the series moved to the magazine Chorus, where it continued its run until the series ended in July 2006 with 64 chapters. Umino received the 27th Kodansha Manga Award for Honey and Clover in 2003, which was adapted into an anime series produced by J.C. Staff.\n\nUmino's most recent work is March Comes in Like a Lion (3月のライオン, Sangatsu no Raion) lit. \"Lion in March\" or \"March's Lion\", which began serialization in Hakusensha's seinen manga magazine, Young Animal. In 2009, she provided the character designs for original anime series, Eden of the East, by director Kenji Kamiyama.\n\nUmino has also illustrated \"Tobira wo Akete\" and the Glass Heart series, including \"Boukensha-tachi\", \"Netsu no Shiro\" and \"Love Way.\"\n\nTwitter: @CHICAUMINO"

Yana is her real first name, but Toboso is not her real surname. In reality, \"Yana\" and \"Toboso\" are both different ways to pronounce \"kururu\" (枢), which means \"to pivot/turn.\"\n\nToboso often likes to bring up her dislike for being mistakenly called \"Yana Hitsugi\" by her fans, as the kanji for Hitsugi means \"coffin\" (柩) but looks similar in appearance for the kanji for \"toboso.\"\n\nHer assistants include Satorigi Akiyo, Hazuki Wakana and her editor is Kuma Takeshi, a former mangaka. She is friends with manga artist, Fujiwara Cocoa.\n\nYana Toboso draws herself as a devil with a black body and horns, a round white head, and a pointed tail. She has never showed a real picture of herself, so her actual appearance is unknown.\n\nBefore Volume 4, Toboso's devil had hair. Though, she later states that she had a bald spot the size of a ¥10 coin.\n\nBlog: http://yanatoboso.tuna.be/\nTwitter: @toboso_official"

He was also publishing a twelve volume series over twelve months for the Kodansha Box line; Ryusui Seiryoin was matching this output, and the Kodansha Box website stated that this is the first time in the world two authors have done twelve volume monthly novel series simultaneously from the same publisher.\n\nIn February, 2008, his novel Death Note Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases was released in English by Viz Media. Del Rey Manga has already released the first volume in his Zaregoto series. His Bakemonogatari and Katanagatari novels have been adapted into anime.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He was hired by Shueisha in 2012 when he requested being the one to draw Dragon Ball Super and debuted his career as an official manga artist under the name Toyotaru. He created the manga adaptation for the Dragon Ball Z anime 2015 film, Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’, titled Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ - Special One Shot. Toyotaru drew two pages of Dragon Ball Super as demonstration, and Toriyama chose him as his successor.\n\nToyotarou is also the official artist of the manga version of Dragon Ball Super. As of the Universe Survival Saga Toyotarou has also become a character designer for Dragon Ball Super, creating designs either by himself or by working together with Toriyama. He also drew Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 The Manga. \n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Wikia)"

However at grade 4 in school he showed his work to his father who promptly laughed at it, after which Sorachi temporarily abandoned his aims of being a manga artist. After graduation, he could not find a job, thus he turned to drawing manga (which he had already learned in university). He was able to gain some recognition through his first work Dandylion and subsequently progressed in his career (the comic is shown in the first volume of Gintama, with a foreword by Hideaki stating that it was his first work).\n\nIn 2003, Sorachi's editor attempted to coax him to create a new series due to a new television program on the Shinsengumi airing on Japanese TV the next year. Yet Sorachi's original idea was to ride on the coattails of the Harry Potter franchise with a series about a school for demon dispellers. After several arguments and an attempt to write the Shinsengumi series, Sorachi gave up, took what he had of the script and twisted it to become the pseudo-historical science fiction series Gintama. (stated in Gintama Volume 1)\n\nHideaki Sorachi holds a degree in commercial advertising (again, stated in volume 11).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

His prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as \"the father of manga,\" \"the godfather of manga\" and \"the god of manga.\" Additionally, he is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who served as a major inspiration during Tezuka's formative years.\n\nTezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947. His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well-received manga series including Tetsuwan Atom, Jungle Taitei, Black Jack, and Hi no Tori, all of which won several awards.\n\nTezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of Hi no Tori, which were never released.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

    "about": "Died: January 28, 1998 (aged 60)\n\nShoutarou Ishinomori was an influential figure in manga, anime, and tokusatsu who created several immensely popular long-running series such as Cyborg 009, what would go on to become the Super Sentai series and the Kamen Rider Series. He was twice awarded by the Shogakukan Manga Award, in 1968 for Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae and in 1988 for Hotel and Manga Nihon Keizai Nyumon. He was born and named Shoutarou Onodera (小野寺 章太郎) in Tome, Miyagi, and was also known as Shoutarou Ishimori (石森 章太郎) before 1986, when he changed his family name to Ishinomori with \"ノ\".\n\nCyborg 009, created in 1963, became the first superpowered hero team created in Japan. That same year, Kazumasa Hirai and Jiro Kuwata created Japan's first cyborg superhero, 8 Man (which predated Kamen Rider by eight years). The success of the tokusatsu superhero TV series Kamen Rider, produced by Toei Company Ltd. in 1971, led to the birth of the \"Transforming\" (henshin) superhero (human-sized superheroes who transform by doing a pose, and use martial arts to fight henchmen and the weekly monster), and resulted in many sequel shows to this day. Ishinomori then created many similar superhero dramas, which were once again all produced by Toei or in Sarutobi Ecchan's case Toei Animation, including Android Kikaider , Henshin Ninja Arashi, Inazuman, Robotto Keiji, Secret Task Force Goranger (the first Super Sentai series), Kaiketsu Zubat, Akumaizer 3, Sarutobi Ecchan, the Toei Fushigi Comedy Series and countless others. He even created popular children's shows such as Hoshi no Ko Chobin (Chobin, Child of the Stars, 1974, a co-production with Studio Zero which was a major success on Italian television), and Ganbare!! Robokon.\n\nIshinomori's art is quite reminiscent of that of his mentor, Osamu Tezuka. The true story of his first meeting with Tezuka was illustrated in a short four-page tale drawn up as supplementary material for the 1970s Astro Boy manga reprints. Around 1955, Ishinomori submitted work to a contest seeking new talent in the magazine, Manga Shonen. Tezuka was impressed by his drawings and asked Ishinomori to help him with Astro Boy. In the American release, this story can be seen in Volume 15, along with Ishinomori's earliest work on the \"Electro\" story arc.\n\nIshinomori also illustrated a comic adaptation of the Super NES video game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, which was produced for the American publication Nintendo Power. The comic consisted of 12 chapters, which were serialized from January 1992 (Volume 32) to December 1992 (Volume 43). The comic was republished as a graphic novel collection in 1993.\n\nIshinomori died of heart failure on January 28, 1998, just 3 days after his 60th birthday. His final work was the tokusatsu superhero TV series, Voicelugger, televised a year later. Two years later, the Kamen Rider Series would be revived with Kamen Rider Kuuga. All of the series made in the Heisei period credit Ishinomori as the creator. The Ishinomori Manga Museum named in his honor opened in Ishinomaki, Miyagi in 2001.[2] Special trains in the Senseki Line were commissioned featuring his artwork generally leading to the museum.\n\nHis work posthumously awarded him the Guinness World Record for most comics published by one author, totaling over 128,000 pages.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Early in Koike's career, he studied under Golgo 13's creator Takao Saito and served as a writer on the series. Koike, along with artist Goseki Kojima, made the manga Kozure Okami (Lone Wolf and Cub), and Koike also contributed to the scripts for the 1970s film adaptations of the series, which starred famous Japanese actor Tomisaburo Wakayama. Koike and Kojima became known as the \"Golden Duo\" because of the success of Kozure Okami. Another series written by Koike, Crying Freeman, which was illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami, was adapted into a 1995 live-action film by French director Christophe Gans. Kazuo Koike started the Gekika Sonjuku, a college course meant to teach people how to be mangaka. In addition to his more violent, action-oriented manga, Koike, an avid golfer, has also written golf manga.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nTwitter: @koikekazuo\nFacebook: @kazuo.koike.9674"

The author's preferred romanization of her penname is not capitalized (est em) and is derived from 'esu to emu' (S and M).\n\nShe debuted with three yaoi collections after being scouted in art school. She was a student of Rachel Thorn, who provided translations for some of the English licenses of her work. Her work has been praised as having unusual maturity and depth, both for yaoi and for manga in general. \n\nHer works tend to have a strong common theme connecting the stories in each of her collections. Seduce Me After the Show centers on the artistic worlds of dance, art and music, while Red Blinds the Foolish contains five short stories that are either set in Spain or have Spanish characters.\n\nAnother common trait is that her stories tend to depict sets of strong dichotomies between contrasting themes, ideals, cultures, artistic styles, and personalities that are all embedded in the intense and passionate relationships between her characters and in her artwork, which is distinctive as it makes use of simple lines and negative space.\n\nDoujinshi Circle: Zangyou Teate (残業手当)\n\n(Source: MU, Wikipedia)\n\nTwitter: @estem_info"

    "about": "Real name is unknown.\n\nShiina Takashi is a Japanese manga artist who writes primarily for the weekly Shogakukan manga publication Weekly Shounen Sunday. When he started at the company in 1989, he began with an anthology of various shorts and one-shots collectively known as Shiina Department Store. Eventually one of these one-shots, about a beautiful, money grubbing female exorcist and her lecherous companion, would become the basis of his most well know work: Ghost Sweeper Mikami: Gokuraku Daisakusen!! (more well known by its shorter name: Ghost Sweeper Mikami, or GS Mikami) Running from 1991 through 1999, it became well known and popular work in Sunday, even leading to an anime of the series from 1993 through 1994 by Toei Animation as well as a Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen in 1993. Even as he had success with Mikami, Shiina continued to create various one-shot stories on the side of his main series.\n\nAfter the end of GS Mikami, Shiina tried to create new series for the manga anthology, such as Ichiban-yu no Kanata and Mister Japan. He also created new series and shorts on the side, including GS Holmes: Gokuraku Daisakusen!! (an alternate take on Sherlock Holmes co-starring the robotic Maria from GS Mikami) In 2003, Shiina introduced another of his many ideas in Shounen Sunday in short form: Zettai Karen Children, about three young girls with great psychic powers and terrifying ambitions. Finding some success with it in short form, the mangaka introduced it as a weekly series in 2005, where it continues to run at this time.\n\nBlog: http://cnanews.asablo.jp/blog/\n\nPictured with voice actress Ootake Miyu.\n\n(Source: AniDB)\n\nTwitter: @Takashi_Shiina"

    "about": "Take was born on December 21st, 1983, and she lives in Tokyo, Japan. She began drawing when she was around 3 or 4 years old. She did not like studying very much, but was always praised for drawing. She felt that it would be nice to draw pictures that were needed by someone, so they frequently drew pictures for their friends, family, and schoolteachers. In her elementary graduation statement, they wrote \"I will get a job related to painting in the future\". \n\nWhen Take was around 15 or 16 years old, she discovered bulletin boards online, and participated in oekaki boards. At 17, her work was discovered by an editor at Kodansha, and Take made her professional debut illustrating the first light novel of Niso Isin's Zaregoto series.\n\nShe predominantly illustrates using Adobe Illustrator, but sometimes uses Adobe Photoshop and Paint Tool SAI. She is a fan of and influenced by the works of Osamu Tezuka, Studio Ghibli, Tatsunoko Production and Akiman. \n\nTwitter: @_take_oekaki"

He has also been influenced by bands such as THE BACK HORN and composers such as Satoru Kosaki.\n\nHe is a relatively new producer, having only been active since early 2011, but is quickly becoming well known. On September 30, 2011, Jin submitted the song \"Kagerou Days\" (カゲロウデイズ) to Nico Nico Douga. The song quickly gained popularity and has since been viewed more than 3,000,000 times.\n\nTwitter: @jin_jin_suruyo"

Subsequently, he changed his pseudonym to Kugane Maruyama when Overlord got published; he didn't want readers to cast strange eyes when purchasing Overlord since Muchimuchi Puririn means \"blubbery fatty.\"\n\nHis short story Dawn has been adapted in Kagetsu Tohya which is Type-Moon's sequel to their earlier doujin visual novel game, Tsukihime, released in August 2001.\n\nEven Nasu Kinoko, the writer of Fate/stay night, praised his work but Maruyama gave up the dream of becoming a writer because he felt the difference in talent between Nasu and himself.\n\nHe is a big fan of the Dungeon and Dragons game. One of the reason he started writing again was all of his DnD buddies were too busy to play with him.\n\nTwitter: @maruyama_kugane"

    "about": "Kuwata Jirou, alternatively 桑田二郎, born April 17, 1935 in Suita, Osaka is a Japanese mangaka.\n\nA gifted artist, Kuwata started out as a manga artist at the young age of 13, when he created The Strange Star Cluster (怪奇星団) in 1948. His turning point came in 1957, when he created Phantom Detective (まぼろし探偵) (which was adapted into a tokusatsu TV series in 1959). Since then, Kuwata devoted himself to creating science fiction/superhero adventures. His most famous was 8 Man, which he co-created with writer Kazumasa Hirai.\n\nUnfortunately, in 1965, when he was to finish the final issue of 8 Man, he was arrested for possessing a handgun (he had contemplated suicide). With Kuwata in jail, co-creator Hirai got other manga artists to finish the final issue, but wasn't satisfied with it. It was published in a manga magazine, but has never before been reprinted.\n\nNevertheless, Kuwata, released from prison shortly thereafter, continued his manga work well into the 1970s, but also ran into depression and alcoholism. In 1977, he had an epiphany and converted to Buddhism. He has since done beautiful art books about the life of Buddha. He also occasionally got back into manga work, and in 1992, he agreed to do his own version of the final issue of 8 Man, upon being asked by co-creator/friend Kazumasa Hirai. \n\n(Source: AniDB)\n\nDate of death:July 2, 2020"
