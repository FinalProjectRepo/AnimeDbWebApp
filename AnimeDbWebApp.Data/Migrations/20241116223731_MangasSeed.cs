Joutarou has locked himself in a jail cell out of fear that an evil spirit is possessing him and that he may cause harm to others. However, Joseph reveals the truth to Joutarou: this \"spirit\" is really a \"Stand,\" a physical manifestation of one's fighting spirit. What's more, Joseph and his companion Mohammed Avdol possess Stands of their own and have learned to control them with ease.\n\nJoseph's arrival comes with another piece of news: an old family enemy has returned from the grave, causing the Stands of the Joestar family to awaken. However, when a Stand manifests within Holly, her inability to cope with it leaves her gravely ill, stirring the men into action.\n\nArmed with the power of Stands, a globe-trotting adventure from Japan to Egypt—where their adversary resides—begins. Meeting an array of nefarious Stand users along the way, as well as new allies, the team leads a crusade to save Holly and put an end to their enemy for good.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders", "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3: Stardust Crusaders", "ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 スターダストクルセイダース", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/872/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_3__Stardust_Crusaders", 16 },

They were valuable to both sides of the war; the Earth Federation designed the Flash System which allowed a Newtype pilot to control a horde of unmanned MS, called Bit-Mobile Suits.This was an effective weapon, but sacrificed the lives of many Newtypes. \n\nSpace fought back for principal, believing the effect of living in Space heightened every human ability and eventually created the prized power of a Newtype, who was not something to use as a tool for war. But in the end, mankind was its own downfall. During the final battle, the Space Revolution Army (SRA) crashed numerous colonies into the planet Earth, with a devastating effect. \n\nMillions died as a result of the colony drop.

And when Tiffa shows Garrod the Gundam X, Garrod can do nothing but bear witness to the suddenly changing times. He may learn that people's true intentions run far deeper, and that the Vultures and Captain Jamil Neate are their only hope for surviving the coming age, and the birth of the New Earth Federation. \n\nMust mankind repeat the tragic mistake of the past?", "Kidou Shin Seiki Gundam X", null, "機動新世紀ガンダムＸ", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/20221/Kidou_Shin_Seiki_Gundam_X", 3 },

Unfortunately a Zaku II begis to open fire on the area of the ship where Professor Minovsky, had been sitting only moments before.\n\nTrenov Y. Minovsky was born in 1983 (U.C. 0015) in the Ural regions near Chernobyl, Ukraine. At age three, Trenov witnesses the Chernobyl Disaster. After moving to America in 1999 (U.C. 0031) he enrolled in school and began research on a fictitious particle known as \"Minovsky Physics\". But at the time his research was far too unrealistic, and no one understood where he was going with it. However, one of his buddies, Ionesco, informs him that Anaheim Electronics has agreed to sponsor his research. He is thrilled at this, much to the chagrin of Ionesco. Shortly thereafter in U.C. 0040, the Minovsky particle is discovered. However, at a scientific conference, it is determined that the Minovsky particle has no relation to nuclear fusion reactors and that his thesis has no conclusive evidence. The reason behind it comes from Ionesco saying that it only has conventional technological applications. Ionesco also refutes Minovsky's research by stating that a particle with a special nature like it was never detected. As of this, he was deemed an impostor and forever banned from the scientific community. A short time later, he is approached by a representative of Zeon Zum Deikun and later moves to Side 3 in U.C. 0045, and around the same time he created a nuclear fusion generator which was then used to create a artificial Sun for the Colony. At the same time, the \"Minovsky Physics Society\" is established and weapons development is started. However, as he becomes increasingly obsessed with weapons development, which leads to his wife leaving him. Following the death of Zeon Zum Deikun in U.C. 0070, Minovsky receives an award for his developments, but tosses it aside in front of the entire Zabi family. From here he goes back to Earth to once again visit what remains his home of Chernobyl. Presumably sometime in U.C. 0080 he declares silently to himself that he \"beat you\" in reference to the RX-78-2 Gundam, as Minovsky existence alone had brought about more destruction than the Gundam's existence, he also goes on to say that he also probably lost to you in the end anyhow. \n\n(Source: gundam.wikia)", "Stampede: The Story of Professor Minovsky", null, "STAMPEDE ミノフスキー博士物語", 3, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/42571/Stampede__The_Story_of_Professor_Minovsky", null },

Guideau, a young woman with the eyes of a beast and a knack for rushing into things head-on, has a deeply personal grudge against witches. Ashaf, a refined yet enigmatic man who carries a coffin on his back, keeps his partner in check with a calm manner and presence of mind. Together, they investigate magical mysteries and crimes, all while looking for the witch who cursed Guideau.\n\nThe pair arrive in a city where they have heard a witch resides; however, much to their surprise, the people of the city consider the witch to be a hero protecting them. Both Guideau and Ashaf believe that only trouble follows a witch wherever she goes—but that remains to be seen here.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 6: Majo no Kimagure (Witch and Whim)", "Majo to Yajuu", "The Witch and the Beast", "魔女と野獣", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/106204/Majo_to_Yajuu", 10 },

Atsuomi, who is busy pursuing his ambitions, brings them to fruition and names the institution he establishes the White Room.
