Once the saviors of the kingdom of Midland, the Band of the Hawk are now hunted as they desperately fight for their lives while plotting to free their leader, Griffith, after he was imprisoned for committing treason.

The entire Band of the Hawk want to rise to greatness once more, but how much are they willing to sacrifice to return to their past glory? It doesn't seem possible, but when Griffith's heart darkens and a solar eclipse blackens the sky, the Behelit offers a choice that will leave the Band of the Hawk with a blood-soaked fate that will haunt them for the rest of their days.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Berserk: Ougon Jidai-hen III - Kourin", "Berserk: The Golden Age Arc III - The Advent", "ベルセルク 黄金時代篇Ⅲ 降臨", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36IMbYmdSWM", 2, "https://myanimelist.net/anime/12115/Berserk__Ougon_Jidai-hen_III_-_Kourin" },

This was also the same issue that had problems releasing the series outside of Japan with France adopting the Edgar de la Cambriole name, Lupin was renamed to Wolf or Cliff in the US while Spain and Italy that kept the Lupin name had to distance from Arsène Lupin affecting later dubbed episodes of Lupin the 3rd Part 2.

With the ushering in of a brand new school year, he decides to enroll in Ooezo Agricultural High School, a boarding school located in the Hokkaido countryside, as a means to escape from the stress brought upon by his parents.\n \nInitially convinced that he would do well at this institution, Hachiken is quickly proven wrong by his talented classmates, individuals who have been living on farms their entire lives and know just about everything when it comes to food, vegetables, and even the physiology of livestock! Whether it be waking up at five in the morning for strenuous labor or to take care of farm animals, Hachiken is a complete amateur when it comes to the harsh agricultural life.\n \nGin no Saji follows the comedic story of a young student as he tries to fit into a completely new environment, meeting many unique people along the way. As he struggles to appreciate his surroundings, Hachiken hopes to discover his dreams, so that he may lead a fulfilling life on his own terms.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Gin no Saji", "Silver Spoon", "銀の匙", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-yCzcYqH5E", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/anime/16918/Gin_no_Saji" },

As fate would have it, Kazuha is going to face Momiji in the Hyakunin Isshu, so she begins to train with the help of Heiji's mother, Shizuka, who is a skilled Karuta player.\n\nAt the same time, in a Japanese house in Arashiyama, Kyoto's outskirts, the reigning Satsuki Cup champion is murdered. Pictures of the crime scene reveal Momji's presence. Additionally, several Karuta cards were spread around the victim.\n\nConan and Heiji, along with the Osaka and Kyoto police departments, begin their investigation on the Satsuki Cup and the related murder case. As the inquiry goes on, they come across a secret connected with the Hyakunin Isshu. \n\n(Source: Detective Conan Wiki)", "Meitantei Conan Movie 21: Karakurenai no Love Letter", "Detective Conan Movie 21: The Crimson Love Letter", "劇場版『名探偵コナン から紅の恋歌』", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d44tuuPbAw8", 2, "https://myanimelist.net/anime/34430/Meitantei_Conan_Movie_21__Karakurenai_no_Love_Letter" },

What they find there are a refugee group that calls itself \"N\" and a hostile American Special Forces unit. As the risk of nuclear war set off by a hijacked submarine grows ever greater, the three-way battle between Public Security Section 9, America, and the Posthumans intensifies.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "Koukaku Kidoutai: SAC_2045 Season 2", "Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045 Season 2", "攻殻機動隊 SAC_2045 シーズン２", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7YWJ7vWVtk", 6, "https://myanimelist.net/anime/41750/Koukaku_Kidoutai__SAC_2045_Season_2" },

He uses Guts to further his ambitious rise to power, taking advantage of the swordsman's lack of aspiration.\n\nEven as he grows closer to Casca, Guts' absence of direction robs him of any sense of belonging. Fostering opposing desires, Guts and Casca fight for Griffith's dream—although fractures forming among the trio threaten to disrupt their world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Berserk: Ougon Jidai-hen - Memorial Edition", "Berserk: The Golden Age Arc - Memorial Edition", "ベルセルク 黄金時代篇　MEMORIAL EDITION", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dkuEdzaFY", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/anime/52976/Berserk__Ougon_Jidai-hen_-_Memorial_Edition" },

When the party disbands after their victory, Frieren casually returns to her \"usual\" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences she went through.\n\nAs the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better understand humans and create real personal connections.

While Subaru is kind and shy, Hokuto has exuberance to spare, and her favorite pastime is designing bold matching outfits for the two of them to wear. Her next favorite thing to do is try to set up Subaru with their veterinarian friend Seishirou Sakurazuka who, oddly enough, is always readily available to accompany the Sumeragis throughout the city.\n\nSubaru has to resolve a variety of spiritual conflicts in Tokyo: some are cases formally brought to him by clients, and others are matters in which he decides to involve himself. A selfless teenager, he empathizes with others to the point that their pain may as well be his own. This leaves him vulnerable in a city where nearly everyone makes decisions that only benefit themselves as individuals. Hokuto hopes that if Subaru develops feelings for Seishirou, their relationship will be the one thing that he never gives up for the sake of anyone else. However, is Seishirou the best candidate for her brother's love, or is he hiding sinister secrets?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Tokyo Babylon", "Tokyo Babylon", "東京 BABYLON", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/133/Tokyo_Babylon", 7 },

Confronting the governments of the world, a yellow tentacled monster boasts that it was the one responsible for the catastrophe, and in a year's time, it will do the same to Earth. Zooming around at Mach 20, the creature makes a peculiar demand: a teaching position at the prestigious Kunugigaoka Junior High School. Desperate to keep the creature in one place, the government agrees, and so the students of Class 3-E find themselves faced with an impossible task—assassinate the creature responsible for destroying the moon.\n\nAlthough the fate of the world now rests on their shoulders, the class has more personal issues to deal with. Trapped at the bottom of Kunugigaoka's hierarchical education system, they face harsh discrimination from both teachers and students alike. Defeatism abound, they don't believe themselves capable of success in daily life, let alone against a monster that surpasses the abilities of any human. But as the enigmatic creature—whom they dub Koro-sensei—educates them in both assassination and academia, the children slowly find the courage to rise up and take aim at their target: the greatest teacher the world has ever seen.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 21: Tokyo Department Sensou Taikenki (Tokyo Department Store War Chronicles)", "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu", "Assassination Classroom", "暗殺教室", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/39883/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu", 21 },

Unfortunately a Zaku II begis to open fire on the area of the ship where Professor Minovsky, had been sitting only moments before.\n\nTrenov Y. Minovsky was born in 1983 (U.C. 0015) in the Ural regions near Chernobyl, Ukraine. At age three, Trenov witnesses the Chernobyl Disaster. After moving to America in 1999 (U.C. 0031) he enrolled in school and began research on a fictitious particle known as \"Minovsky Physics\". But at the time his research was far too unrealistic, and no one understood where he was going with it. However, one of his buddies, Ionesco, informs him that Anaheim Electronics has agreed to sponsor his research. He is thrilled at this, much to the chagrin of Ionesco. Shortly thereafter in U.C. 0040, the Minovsky particle is discovered. However, at a scientific conference, it is determined that the Minovsky particle has no relation to nuclear fusion reactors and that his thesis has no conclusive evidence. The reason behind it comes from Ionesco saying that it only has conventional technological applications. Ionesco also refutes Minovsky's research by stating that a particle with a special nature like it was never detected. As of this, he was deemed an impostor and forever banned from the scientific community. A short time later, he is approached by a representative of Zeon Zum Deikun and later moves to Side 3 in U.C. 0045, and around the same time he created a nuclear fusion generator which was then used to create a artificial Sun for the Colony. At the same time, the \"Minovsky Physics Society\" is established and weapons development is started. However, as he becomes increasingly obsessed with weapons development, which leads to his wife leaving him. Following the death of Zeon Zum Deikun in U.C. 0070, Minovsky receives an award for his developments, but tosses it aside in front of the entire Zabi family. From here he goes back to Earth to once again visit what remains his home of Chernobyl. Presumably sometime in U.C. 0080 he declares silently to himself that he \"beat you\" in reference to the RX-78-2 Gundam, as Minovsky existence alone had brought about more destruction than the Gundam's existence, he also goes on to say that he also probably lost to you in the end anyhow. \n\n(Source: gundam.wikia)", "Stampede: The Story of Professor Minovsky", null, "STAMPEDE ミノフスキー博士物語", 3, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/42571/Stampede__The_Story_of_Professor_Minovsky", null },

When she discovers a photograph featuring Sasuke's old comrade Karin, Sarada is shocked to discover that she bears more of a resemblance to this strange woman than she does to her mother.\n\nWhen Sasuke returns to the village with news of a massive impending threat, Naruto obeys his duty as the Seventh Hokage and accompanies his old friend on an investigative mission. Unbeknownst to them both, Sarada and her friend Chouchou Akimichi pursue them, intent on solving the mystery of Sarada's parentage.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Naruto Gaiden: Nanadaime Hokage to Akairo no Hanatsuzuki", "Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring", "NARUTO外伝 七代目火影と緋色の花つ月", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/87866/Naruto_Gaiden__Nanadaime_Hokage_to_Akairo_no_Hanatsuzuki", 1 },

Some have found peace while others continue to fight.\n\nAfter a remaining faction tried to revive the revolution, Shishio's old sword fell into the hands of Ashitarou Hasegawa, an orphan boy who has never known a home. The conflict also leaves both Aran Inoue, a 16-year-old half-Japanese, half-American boy, and a mercenary girl named Asahi Kubota with a hefty price to pay off, with nowhere else to go. But luckily for these individuals, the Kamiya dojo has always been a place to accept wanderers without prying into their pasts.\n\nThe three are keen to start fresh, so when two members of Asahi's former clan show up demanding her return, Asahi refuses and things start to get ugly. In the midst of the chaos, the clan members drop a package containing a picture of dojo proprietor Kaoru Kamiya's presumably deceased father and his location—Hakodate, Hokkaido. With only this information, the members of the Kamiya dojo embark on an adventure across the sea in the hopes of finding news about Kaoru's father and the reason he is being targeted.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Hokkaido-hen", "Rurouni Kenshin: Hokkaido Arc", "るろうに剣心－明治剣客浪漫譚・北海道編－", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/105837/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_-_Hokkaido-hen", null },

Therefore, if Yuuji were to consume the many other remnants of Sukuna, then Yuuji's subsequent execution would truly eradicate the malicious demon. Taking up this chance to make the world safer and live his life for a little longer, Yuuji enrolls in Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, jumping headfirst into a harsh and unforgiving battlefield.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Jujutsu Kaisen", "Jujutsu Kaisen", "呪術廻戦", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/113138/Jujutsu_Kaisen", 30 },

However, a new hope arose, as the discovery of a Mato fruit that grants supernatural abilities exclusively to women allowed them to fight against the Shuuki.

Operating as Westalis' master spy, Twilight works tirelessly to prevent extremists from sparking a war with neighboring country Ostania. For his latest mission, he must investigate Ostanian politician Donovan Desmond by infiltrating his son's school: the prestigious Eden Academy. Thus, the agent faces the most difficult task of his career: get married, have a child, and play family.\n\nTwilight, or \"Loid Forger,\" quickly adopts the unassuming orphan Anya to play the role of a six-year-old daughter and prospective Eden Academy student. For a wife, he comes across Yor Briar, an absent-minded office worker who needs a pretend partner of her own to impress her friends. However, Loid is not the only one with a hidden nature. Yor moonlights as the lethal assassin \"Thorn Princess.\" For her, marrying Loid creates the perfect cover. Meanwhile, Anya is not the ordinary girl she appears to be; she is an esper, the product of secret experiments that allow her to read minds. Although she uncovers their true identities, Anya is thrilled that her new parents are cool secret agents! She would never tell them, of course. That would ruin the fun.\n\nUnder the guise of \"The Forgers,\" the spy, the assassin, and the esper must act as a family while carrying out their own agendas. Although these liars and misfits are only playing parts, they soon find that family is about far more than blood relations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Spy x Family", "Spy x Family", "SPY×FAMILY", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/119161/Spy_x_Family", null },

Surprisingly, she is instead captivated by this revelation. Nonetheless, he still rejects her, but Saki's determination does not stop her from declaring that she will become his first love. With Saki and his childhood friend at his side, Makoto's world brightens, giving him strength amid his struggle between his interests and the expectations placed on him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Senpai wa Otokonoko", "Senpai Is an Otokonoko: My Crossdressing Classmate", "先輩はおとこのこ", 1, "https://myanimelist.net/manga/137982/Senpai_wa_Otokonoko", null },
